                        <p class = "contentDescriptionText">The arm is made up of varyingly sized servo motors, each connected together with 3d printed segments. A 3d printed base is responsible for providing a strong point for bench vice connections and relieving loads on the longitudinally rotating servo. The relief is achieved by connecting the servo to the arm via a shaft held to the base by a bearing.</p>
                        <p class = "contentDescriptionText">A large part of the project was learning about and deriving the inverse-kinematics for a variably sized robot arm. The location of each point is calculated in succession from the target point back to the origin. The points are then used to generate each servo's angle.</p>

Once started, a pattern will show up on a matrix and the user will have a set amount of time to memorise the pattern. A progress bar will indicate the time left and the user will then have to recall the pattern by clicking on the matrix's cells. The user is given a fixed amount of time to do this, which is indicated again by a progress bar. Once the round is over the user will be shown their mistakes and their score will be updated.</p>
