                        I am a developer and aerospace engineering student. I have experience with ray tracing, robotics, API scraping and CAD. 
                        I explore these fields by working on various of personal projects, a selection of which are showcased below.

                            The arm is made up of servo motors of varying sizes, each connected with 3D-printed segments.
                            A 3D-printed base provides a strong connection point for a bench vise and relieves loads on the longitudinally rotating servo. 
                            This is achieved by connecting the servo to the arm via a shaft held to the base by a bearing.</p>

                            A significant part of this project was learning about and deriving the inverse kinematics for a variably sized robot arm. 
                            The location of each point is calculated sequentially from the target back to the origin. These points are then used to generate each servo's angle.

                            A test of the user's visual memory. The user selects a difficulty level and starts the game. 
                            Once started, a pattern appears on a matrix, and the user has a set amount of time to memorize it. 
                            A progress bar indicates the remaining time. The user must then recall the pattern by clicking on the matrix's cells. 
                            They are given a fixed amount of time for this, as indicated by the progress bar. 
                            Once the round is over, mistakes are shown, and the user's score is updated.
